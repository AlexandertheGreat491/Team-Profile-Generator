# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

I created this project to enable the user to create roster of the employees using Jest, Inquirer, Nodejs, JavaScript, and customized styling and the Materialize CSS framework. I learned how to apply what I already knew about generating files, Nodejs, JavaScript, and Inquirer to being partnered with Jest, object-oriented programming, and test-driven development.

## Installation

## Usage

The app can be used by accessing the public GitHub repository as specified in the Installation instructions, cloning the code to your local computer, and running the app in the command line using index.js.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
