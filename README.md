# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

I created this project to enable the user to create roster of the employees using Jest, Inquirer, Nodejs, JavaScript, and customized styling and the Materialize CSS framework. I learned how to apply what I already knew about generating files, Nodejs, JavaScript, and Inquirer to being partnered with Jest, object-oriented programming, and test-driven development.
